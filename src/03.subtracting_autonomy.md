##03 - Subcontracting and Autonomy

At times, it may be necessary for me to subcontract out work to other developers or designers in order to ensure project completion lines up with desired deadlines. I reserve the right to hire such extra help without notice or review by yourself, and I accept full responsibility for work done by these workers as if it were my own.

Additionally, by signing this document, you agree that you will not have any third parties modifying the codebase or resources created by myself without my prior knowledge and consent. This ensures that I am always aware of where the project stands, what needs to be done, and what has been completed.
