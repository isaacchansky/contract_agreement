##04 - Scope of Work

###Scope of Work Agreement
A "Scope of Work Agreement" will be signed before any work is completed on the project, including but not limited to:
  - writing code
  - wireframing
  - creating mockups
  - researching concepts or potential resources

###Increase of Scope
After we establish a "Scope of Work Agreement" and begin to hit deadlines and milestones, there will very potentially come a time where the work defined in the initial "Scope of Work Agreement" no longer is sufficient, and an increase in the scope of the project will be requested. At this point, a "Scope of Work Increase Agreement" must be put in place to acknowledge the increase in scope and define the new work as a project in itself.
