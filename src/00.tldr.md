#Software Development For Hire Contract Agreement.

##00 - The gist of it

As an independent contractor, I do my best to fulfil your needs and meet expectations. It is important to have clear expectations in writing, as a contract so we both know what's what. This contract contains no complex legal language but is instead focused on conveying the intentions in a way meant to be fully read and fully understood.

In short, you, {{CLIENT}} located at {{CLIENT_ADDRESS}}, are hiring myself, {{COMPANY}} located at {{COMPANY_ADDRESS}}, to complete the job as it is outlined.

By signing this document, you agree that you have the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of yourself, your company, or your organization as appropriate.

For the rest of this contract, "I" refers to {{COMPANY}}, while "you" refers to {{CLIENT}}, unless otherwise noted.
