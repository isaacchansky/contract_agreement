##01 - Our Relationship and Communication

This document creates a non-exclusive business replationship between you and I. I am not an your employee nor do I expect to be granted the same benefits as one. I am an independent contractor, and as such, I may have other clients whose projects may run simultaneously to yours if needed and if scheduling allows. This relationship begins after the signing of this document, and will end when this document is terminated.
